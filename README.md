I have made this extension using WXT + JS and it is working fine and also all of the required functionalities are working fine as well.
You can see functionalities in the video and in the code as well.
I have used the JavaScript as I am not so comfortable with the TypeScript right now and there was not much time for me to learn TypeScript as well as WXT framework, so I made this project using JS, but now I am learning TypeScript and soon I'll be able to master it. 
Thank you.

Build the project :- wxt build
